Jamstack architecture has transformed web development by emphasizing pre-rendering, decoupling, and the use of modern build tools. What began as an approach for simple static sites has evolved into a comprehensive strategy for building dynamic web applications.

## The Original Vision

The term "Jamstack" was coined to represent a specific architectural approach:

### JavaScript, APIs, and Markup

The original formula was straightforward:

- **J**: JavaScript for client-side interactivity
- **A**: APIs to handle dynamic functionality
- **M**: Markup pre-rendered at build time

## Modern Jamstack

Today's Jamstack has evolved significantly:

### Hybrid Rendering

Contemporary Jamstack sites employ multiple rendering strategies:

1. Static generation for marketing pages
2. Server-side rendering for personalized content
3. Client-side rendering for highly interactive elements

### Islands Architecture

The islands architecture pattern optimizes for both performance and dynamism:

```jsx
// Example component using islands architecture
export default function ProductPage({ product }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <StaticHeader />
      <StaticProductDetails product={product} />

      {/* Interactive island */}
      <ClientComponent>
        <DynamicPricingCalculator productId={product.id} />
      </ClientComponent>

      <StaticFooter />
    </div>
  );
}
```
