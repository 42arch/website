Introducing Fumadocs MDX, the official content source of Fumadocs.

## Quick Start

Get started with Fumadocs MDX:

## Introduction

Fumadocs MDX is a tool to transform content into type-safe data, similar to Content Collections.

It is not a full CMS but rather a content compiler + validator, you can use it to handle blog posts and other contents.

### Defining Collections

**Collection** refers to a collection containing a certain type of files. You can define collections in the config file (`source.config.ts`).

Fumadocs MDX transforms collections into type-safe data, accessible in your app. Available collections:


For example, a `doc` collection will transform the `.md` and `.mdx` files:


### Accessing Collections

Collections will be compiled into JavaScript files that your app can access, the output format varies according to the framework you use.

### Built-in Properties

These properties are exported from MDX files by default.

| Property         | Description                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `frontmatter`    | Frontmatter                                     |
| `toc`            | Table of Contents                               |
| `structuredData` | Structured Data, useful for implementing search |

### Customise Frontmatter

Use the [`schema`](/docs/mdx/collections#schema-1) option to pass a validation schema to validate frontmatter and define its output properties.

### MDX Plugins

Fumadocs MDX uses [MDX Compiler](https://mdxjs.com/packages/mdx) to compile MDX files into JavaScript files.

You can customise it on [Global Config](/docs/mdx/global#mdx-options) or [Collection Config](/docs/mdx/collections#mdxoptions).
